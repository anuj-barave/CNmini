            Each IP class is equipped with its own default subnet mask which bounds that IP class to have prefixed
            number of Networks and prefixed number of Hosts per network. Glassful IP addressing does not provide any
            flexibility of having less number of Hosts per Network or more Networks per IP Class.
            CIDR or Classless Inter Domain Routing provides the flexibility of borrowing bits of Host part of the IP
            address and using them as Network in Network, called Subnet. By using subletting, one singled Class A IP
            address can be used to have smaller sub_networks which provides better network management capabilities.<br>
            <br>
            Class A<br>
            In Class A, only the first octet is used as Network identifier and rest of three octets are used to be
            assigned to Hosts (i.e 16777214 Hosts per Network). To make more subnet in Class A, bits from Host part are
            borrowed and the subnet mask is changed accordingly.
            For example, if one MSB (Most Significant Bit) is borrowed from host bits of second octet and added to
            Network address, it creates two Subnets with 8388606 Hosts per Subnet.
            The Subnet mask is changed accordingly to reflect subletting. Given below is list of all possible
            combination of Class A subnets:
            <br>
           

            <br>
            Class B<br>
            By default, using Glassful Networking, 14 bits are used as Network bits providing 16384 Networks and 65534
            Hosts. Class B IP Addresses can be subsetted the same way as Class A addresses, by borrowing bits from Host
            bits. Below is given all possible combination of Class B subnetting:
            <br>
           

            <br>

            Class C<br>
            Class C IP addresses are normally assigned to avery small size networks because it can only have 254 hosts
            in a network. Given below is a list of all possible combination of subsetted Class B IP addresses:

            1) The aim is to Give IP Addresses to the PCs.<br>
            2) To perform the experiment follow the below steps<br>
            3) A choice list would be given defining the Classes<br>
            4) The user has to select the class in which they choose to give IP Addresses<br>
            5) After that a Network ID would be given and the user has to enter the IP Addresses according to the
            Network ID.<br>
            6) Click on submit to test whether the IP address given to PCs make them into Network or not.<br>
