        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">

            A twisted pair consists of two insulated conductor twisted together in the shape of a spiral. It can be
            shielded or unshielded. The unshielded twisted pair cables are very cheap and easy to install. But they are
            very badly affected by the electromagnetic noise interference.
            <br>Twisting of wires will reduce the effect of noise or external interference.The induced emf into the two
            wires due to interference tends to cancel each other due to twisting. Number of twists per unit length will
            determine the quality of cable. More twists means better quality.
            <br>
            There are 3 types of UTP cables:-<br>
            1) Straight-through cable<br>
            2) Crossover cable<br>
            3) Roll-over cable<br>
            <br><br>
            A. Straight-through cable<br>
            Straight-Through refers to cables that have the pin assignments on each end of the cable. In other words Pin
            1 connector A goes to Pin 1 on connector B, Pin 2 to Pin 2 ect. Straight-Through wired cables are most
            commonly used to connect a host to client. When we talk about cat5e patch cables, the Straight-Through wired
            cat5e patch cable is used to connect computers, printers and other network client devices to the router
            switch or hub (the host device in this instance).<br>
            <br><br>
            B. Crossover cable<br>
            Crossover wired cables (commonly called crossover cables) are very much like Straight-Through cables with
            the exception that TX and RX lines are crossed (they are at oposite positions on either end of the cable.
            Using the 568-B standard as an example below you will see that Pin 1 on connector A goes to Pin 3 on
            connector B. Pin 2 on connector A goes to Pin 6 on connector B ect. Crossover cables are most commonly used
            to connect two hosts directly. Examples would be connecting a computer directly to another computer,
            connecting a switch directly to another switch, or connecting a router to a router.Note: While in the past
            when connecting two host devices directly a crossover cable was required. Now days most devices have auto
            sensing technology that detects the cable and device and crosses pairs when needed.<br>
            <br><br>
            C. Roll-over cable<br>
            Rollover wired cables most commonly called rollover cables, have opposite Pin assignments on each end of the
            cable or in other words it is "rolled over". Pin 1 of connector A would be connected to Pin 8 of connector
            B. Pin 2 of connector A would be connected to Pin 7 of connector B and so on. Rollover cables, sometimes
            referred to as Yost cables are most commonly used to connect to a devices console port to make programming
            changes to the device. Unlike crossover and straight-wired cables, rollover cables are not intended to carry
            data but instead create an interface with the device.<br>

        <h2>Procedure :</h2>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">

            1) The aim is to Fabricate a UTP Cable.<br>
            2) To perform the experiment follow the below steps<br>
            3) A choice list would be give that which type of cable is to be fabricated<br>
            4) Select the choice out of the three choices given<br>
            5) Once a selection is done then the user have to make the cable ready <br>
            6) In-order to do so select the color codes on both the sides i.e Switch port and PC port.<br>
            7) After assigning the color codes click on the Start button to observe that the cable made is correct or
            not.<br>
            8) Based on the observations made select if cable made is correct or not.<br>
